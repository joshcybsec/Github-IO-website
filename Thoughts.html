        Thoughts on Ropper's Computing Fundamentals Course
        
      </h1>
      
      <p class="subtitle">
        Computing Fundamentals was a pretty interesting hands on approach to learning the basics of Cyber security or more specifically Linux OS & Linux Command line.
        Much of the lessons & activities revolve around understanding how Linux works as an OS, the command line commands that can be used & OvertheWire Bandit's Wargames as the means to get your hands dirty & understand how to play around with Linux. From what I have read & seen online, this makes sense seeing that the use of Linux is pretty much the standard for Cybersecurity where it is expected to understand & use Linux. This is not to say Windows or MacOS cannot be used, but more often than not, much of the tools used are Linux based. There are also Linux OS such as Kali Linux & Parrot Security which are developed for pen testing.

        In addition, the building of a Linux lab is also a good introduction to the use of VMs which most users are unlikely to have played around with or used on a daily basis. In learning how to setup VMs, I see the benefits of being able to spin up a VM whenever to play around with the different Linux variants without any additional hardware or fear breaking the actual machine I am using. My horizon is opened to the potential of running multiple VMs as a homelab on a network, each for different purpose to see if they would work for my use case. A hardware router with promox running & PFsense as firewall is one project I am contemplating for the future.
